About
============
In odoo, while you confirm the RFQ it will take the current date as confirmation date and you can not change the date after confirming it so our module is useful for confirm purchase orders with selected confirmation backdate. You can put a custom backdate and remarks in the purchase. You can mass assign backdate in one click. When you mass assign backdate, it asks for remarks in the mass assign wizard. This selected date and remarks are also reflects in the receipts, stock moves, product moves, bill & journal entries.


Installation
============
1) Copy module files to addon folder.
2) Restart odoo service (sudo service odoo-server restart).
3) Go to your odoo instance and open apps (make sure to activate debug mode).
4) click on update app list.
5) search module name and hit install button.
